# They Rate Dogs

If you've spent time on Twitter, you've may have come across an account called "We Rate Dogs" that does just that: They rate dogs on a scale from 1-10.

However, the best part about it is that the author really loves dogs, and so they pretty much give every dog at least a 10 - and sometimes the dog is so cute it breaks the scale and gets an 11, a 12, or a 13.

## The Goal

Write some methods that take in some information about a dog and return a rating for that dog.

Follow the challenges in the file named dog_rater.py. When you're ready to test it, run it using the python command in the console:

```bash
python dog_rater.py
```

Be sure to *call* your methods somewhere in the dog_rater.py program in order for them to run, and if you want to actually *see* the results, be sure to print the return values.

```python
# Call your method:
example_method()

# Print the return value of this method:
print(example_method())
```

(It's okay to give really good ratings)

## BONUS: Random Numbers

You may find yourself wanting to make certain parts of the dog rater methods a little more wild and random. If so, you may want to know this cool Python method:

```python
x = randint(5, 10)
```

This code will pick a random integer between 5 and 10 and store it in the variable x, and then you can use it later.
